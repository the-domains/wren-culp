With a passion for journalism and reading, it wasn't until Culp saw the infamous diner scene in David Fincher's _Zodiac_ that he realized he wanted to tell stories visually. He realized that he wanted to craft moments and stories that would stay with audience members long after the credits rolled. A few years later Culp attended the University of North Carolina School of the Arts where he worked day in and day out directing and producing projects, always striving to just tell a good story. You can usually find him buried in a Donna Tartt book, obsessively building the perfect Spotify playlists or huddled in front of a TV cheering on his Denver Broncos.

In May 0f 2016 he proudly received a BFA in filmmaking, and is currently living in Los Angeles.
