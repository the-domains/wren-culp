Wren grew up in the journalism world. That, coupled with the writing gene graciously gifted to him by his parents, was put to use after he joined the high school newspaper, further honing his storytelling abilities. But it wasn't until Wren found himself huddled around a portable DVD player in his room watching _Zodiac _that he realized he wanted to tell stories visually. After that, he never looked back. He found himself a few years later attending the University of North Carolina School of the Arts where he directed multiple projects through the years. You can usually find him buried in a Donna Tartt book or bunched in front of a TV cheering on his Denver Broncos.

In May 0f 2016 he proudly received a BFA in filmmaking, and is currently living in Los Angeles.
