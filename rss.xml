            <title><![CDATA[Wren Culp - Bio]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Wren Culp - Bio</h1><p>Â Wren grew up in the journalism world. That, coupled with the writing gene graciously gifted to him by his parents, was put to use after he joined the high school newspaper, further honing his storytelling abilities. But it wasn't until Wren found himself huddled around a portable DVD player in his room watching Zodiac that he realized he wanted to tell stories visually. After that, he never looked back. He found himself a few years later attending the University of North Carolina School of the Arts where he directed multiple projects through the years. You can usually find him buried in a Donna Tartt book or bunched in front of a TV cheering on his Denver Broncos.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/07e8ba513fc042554806340ab1ff555b1896fbbd.jpg"></article>]]></description>
